The Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program is an advanced certification program hosted by Udacity in collaboration with AWS. You can check for more details regarding this program [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).
Usually this program costs around $1,000 for 3 months of access but I completed this program for free by winning the AWS Deepracer Scholarship.

The requirements for acquiring this certification involved completing 3 projects each of which I have posted seperately in this repository.

In project 1, I had to build and deploy sentiment analysis model using AWS services. The requirements and details of this project along with its solution are given in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jahidahsan/Udacity-MLEND/blob/master/Project%201/SageMaker%20Project.ipynb).

In the second project, I was required to build and deploy plagiarism detector with the help of AWS services. The details of this project are outlined in the [readme file](https://github.com/jahidahsan/Udacity-MLEND/blob/master/Project%202%20Plagiarism%20Detector/README.md) of the folder.

The last project aka capstone project was built using the real world data provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. The details can be found in the [respective folder](https://github.com/jahidahsan/Udacity-MLEND/tree/master/Casptone%20Project).
